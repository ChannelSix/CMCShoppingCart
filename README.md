## To Run
- Change directory to the CMCShoppingCart.UI folder and run: `ng serve`
- Change directory to the CMCShoppingCart folder and run: `dotnet run` or just do it the old fashioned way and open the solution in Visual Studio.

## Things to finish / improve on:
- Styling is terrible
- Client side unit tests
- Stronger coverage of server side unit tests
- Re-implement quantity on purchase (was messing up the styling)
