# Sample shopping basket
## To Install
- Install angular cli globally: `npm i @angular/cli -g`
- Change directory to the CMCShoppingCart.UI folder and download npm packages: `npm i`

## Things to finish / improve on:
- Styling is terrible
- Client side unit tests
- Stronger coverage of server side unit tests
- Re-implement quantity on purchase (was messing up the styling)
